## Hi there! 👋

I’m **Johannes Keisers**, a Biophysics PhD graduate at University of Montpellier working on **data analysis, modelling, and simulations of biological systems**.

I build **end-to-end modelling and data analysis pipelines**: from raw experimental data to mechanistic models, simulations, and visualizations that help explain and predict biological behaviour.

## 🚀 What I’ve Built

📊 **Proteomics data analysis pipeline (Julia)**

- Developed Julia-based pipelines to integrate large-scale proteomics data into mechanistic models, enabling automated normalization and visualization of protein-sector shifts.
- Implemented normalization, aggregation, and visualization of protein abundance data
- Produced reproducible plots and summaries for downstream quantitative analysis

🧬 **Growth law & ribosome dynamics models (Julia)**

- Developed mechanistic models linking growth rate, ribosome activity, and translation dynamics
- Implemented simulations exploring initiation, elongation, and inactive ribosome fractions
- Used modelling to test theoretical predictions against experimental growth data

🎲 **Stochastic transport & TASEP simulations (Julia)**

- Implemented stochastic lattice models (TASEP and related frameworks)
- Analysed emergent system-level behaviour using stochastic simulations

📈 **Growth-rate extraction & time-series analysis tools (Julia / Python)**

- Built tools to extract growth rates from experimental time-series data
- Focused on robust handling of noisy biological measurements
- Packaged analysis routines for reuse across projects

⌚ **Wearable activity data exploration (Python / Jupyter)**

- Performed exploratory analysis of wearable sensor data
- Investigated activity patterns and temporal structure in real-world human data

## 🧰 Tools & Skills

- 🚀 **Julia**, 🐍 **Python**, Jupyter notebooks
- 📈 Time-series analysis & regression
- 🎲 Stochastic modelling & simulations
- 🧮 Mechanistic and statistical models
- 📊 Data visualization & interpretation
- 🔁 Reproducible research workflows (Git)

## 📌 Current Focus

- 🧠 Building interpretable, mechanistic models grounded in real data
- 🧱 Developing clean, reusable analysis and simulation pipelines
- 🔍 Connecting theoretical models with experimental measurements

## 🎯 What I’m Interested In

- Quantitative modelling and simulation roles
- Data analysis roles with a strong modelling component
- Problems involving **stochasticity, finite-size effects, and complex systems**

I’m particularly interested in settings where **models are used to understand mechanisms and guide decisions**.
